# # Modeling ecohydrological response to a storm event

# This Landlab driver illustrates the use of Landlab ecohydrology components to model semi-arid ecohydrological dynamics driven by a storm pulse and solar radiation. Components (names given in parenthesis) we will use are:
# * Solar radiation (Radiation)
# * Potential Evapotranspiration (PotentialEvapotranspiration)
# * Soil Moisture (SoilMoisture)
# * Vegetation (Vegetation)
# A digital elevation model (DEM) of a headwater region in central New Mexico (latitude 34N) will be used as input. 
# Components will be introduced step by step. First, we will start with mapping solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration (PET). Note that some of the commands used are only to provide information about the in/outputs of components and can be deleted or not run. We will then run soil moisture and vegetation modules and show how to write outputs in a file.
# 
# Letâ€™s being importing python libraries, Landlab components, and python plotting tools 

import numpy as np
from landlab.components import Radiation
from landlab.components import PotentialEvapotranspiration
from landlab.io import read_esri_ascii

# Read an existing esri grid as watershed and map the elevation field

# Constructions of Landlab Radiation and Potential Evapotranspiration components and codes can be found in the respective links below.
# http://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.radiation.html and
# http://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.pet.html
# The radation components return relative radiation (ratio of radiation of a slopes surface to flat surface), used to scale PET calculated for flat surface by the PET component. 
# 
# Let's instantiate the radiation and PET components using only variables relevant to this exercise. 

rad = Radiation(watershed, method='Grid', latitude=34.)
PET=PotentialEvapotranspiration(watershed, method='PriestleyTaylor', albedo=0.2, latitude=34., elevation_of_measurement=2, )


# Set the current_time (0-1) in a year, (calculate as DOY/365).
# To see how the magnitude and spatial distribution of radiation and PET changes as a function of DOY we will use two different days, summer and winter solstice. In both cases we will use PET based on the Priestley and Taylor model that requires temperature as input. Temperatures are from cenral NM climatology. In the calculation of PET modeled solar radiation will be used. The Potential Evapotranspiration component of Landlab currently offers several other methods for PET calculation which can be found: http://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/landlab.components.pet.html
# 
# For summer solstice use current_time=0.466 (June 20) and Tmin=14,  Tmax=32, Tavg=23 (degree C) 
# 
# For summer solstice use current_time=0.997 (December 21) and Tmin=-5,  Tmax=11, Tavg=3 (degree C).
# As you do this exercise notice when the spatial variability of radiation and PET becomes more pronounced.

current_time=0.466   # 0: beginning of the calender year 0.5: middle of the year
rad.update(current_time)
PET.update(current_time, Tmin=14, Tmax=32, Tavg=23)  # Daily min, max, and average temperature


# Let's identify the outputs we can plot and examine

# Now you can explore the ecohydrologic response of this model by changing DOY, temperature, lenght of the run (e.g.,Tb), initial soil moisture conditions, and rainfall depth. Note that we make the assumption that PET varaibles do not change over the duration of Tb. For a fully coupled run examples, please see other study examples that use the Cellular Automaton model.
